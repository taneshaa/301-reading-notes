What is functional programming? Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data <br>

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?<br>
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)<br>
It does not cause any observable side effects. An impure function would receive radius as the parameter, and then calculate radius * radius * PI:<br>


What are the benefits of a pure function? <br>
What is immutability?<br>
What is Referential transparency?<br>
